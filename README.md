The contributiontracking.html has the user interface designed using html and css. It has pledge form,contribution form and Donation form. 
The php files that is, pledge.php/contribution.php/donation.php connects the html files with the database then if the connection fails,it displays an error message.They also retrieve data iserted then transports the data into the database for storage.
Then the  report.php fetches data from the database then displays the report inform of a table.
